### Mod development
Run release.py script to create .zip file with mod in /build directory.

### Motivation
Some recipes are completely useless. Look at the "Leached <thing>" recipes. There is so much ore on the map that sulfur is a much more valuable resource. Ionized Fuel and SAM recipes seem as unusable as ore processing. Ionized Fuel provides little amount of energy for a high price. There are also problems with the balance of nuclear technologies: there is no point in recycling waste into better fuel, because there is already enough uranium energy.

### Ore Processing Rebalance 
#### Rebalance
 "Leached" recipes now uses Nitric Acid instead of Sulfuric Acid.

![Leached Copper](https://https://github.com/Demonorium/DAlternativeBalance/tree/master/docs/ore_1)
![Leached Caterium](https://https://github.com/Demonorium/DAlternativeBalance/tree/master/docs/ore_2)

#### Alternate recipes
Additional recipes to produce more ingots and Nitric Acid in late game.

#### Calculations and gameplay
There are two variants of ore processing:
1. 1200 ore per minute require 600 Nitrogen Gas and 100 Sulfuric Acid.
2. 1200 ore per minute require 150 Nitric Acid.

Chain of processing method forces Pioneer to build large ore processing factories.

### Oil and Fuel Rebalance
#### Rebalance
Ionized Fuel energy output 5,000 -> 7,000

Recipe now produces 50 fuel per 1 shard.

#### Calculations and gameplay
Additional recipes for oil production are consumers of Silica. Additional Sulfur production is useful for effective steel/ore/fuel production.

### SAM Rebalance
#### Alternate recipes
![Alt SAM 1](https://https://github.com/Demonorium/DAlternativeBalance/tree/master/docs/SAM_0)
![Alt SAM 2](https://https://github.com/Demonorium/DAlternativeBalance/tree/master/docs/SAM_1)

![Alt Fluctuator](https://https://github.com/Demonorium/DAlternativeBalance/tree/master/docs/SAM_4)
![Alt Singularity Cell](https://https://github.com/Demonorium/DAlternativeBalance/tree/master/docs/SAM_5)
![Alt Nuclear Pasta](https://https://github.com/Demonorium/DAlternativeBalance/tree/master/docs/SAM_6)

#### gameplay
The main purpose of changes is to reduce cost of SAM, to make it more usable. Also there are reduction of copper dust consumption.

### Nuclear power Rebalance
1. Uranium rod energy output 50%
2. Plutonium rod energy output 150%
3. Ficsonium rod energy output 300%
